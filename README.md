The website for the [Green Tortoise Seattle](http://greentortoise.net/) is a fork from the WrapBootstrap theme FullScreen.  More information on that project follows.

Hosting is by Amazon AWS & specifically S3 using the excellent [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) Ruby Gem.

At SimplifyMy.Biz we use Open Source and customize it for your business.  We then return back to the community the how and why on our blogs, [the how - sandorsscribbles.es](http://sandorsscribbl.es/) and [the why - sandorsharangu.es](http://sandorsharangu.es/).
